## What will I build?

i'm trying to demonstrate my newly learned skills to create a full stack drink menu application. The application must:

- Display graphics representing the ratios of ingredients in each drink.
- Allow public users to view drink names and graphics.
- Allow the shop baristas to see the recipe information.
- Allow the shop managers to create new drinks and edit existing drinks.

also this project will give me a hands-on chance to practice and demonstrate what I've learned, such as:

- Implementing authentication and authorization in Flask
- Designing against key security principals
- Implementing role-based control design patterns
- Securing a REST API
- Applying software system risk and compliance principles
